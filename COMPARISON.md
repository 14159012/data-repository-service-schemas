A place to put a comparison of endpoints/features in DOS to GDC, ICGC, HCA, and potentially other systems.

Brian W. took the first pass at a comparison between GDC and DOS.  See https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CCzsff4PZcNwysKPBzHSbTiP611HJO8jDVF1fjEY1nY/edit#slide=id.p

Feature/Endpoints  | DOS | HCA Data Store | ICGC Storage | GDC Signpost
------------------ | --- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------

TODO: fill this in based on the above from Brian W.
